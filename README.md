# Hospital Operations and Patient Analytics Dashboard using Power BI – A Case Study on Papollo Hospitals
## The project is a Power BI interactive dashboard built for Papollo Hospitals, focusing on analyzing hospital operations and patient data. The dashboard covers multiple aspects including admissions, discharges, follow-ups, billing, insurance claims, bed occupancy, diagnostics, and doctor performance.

The goal of the project is to help hospital management gain actionable insights into patient flow, financial performance, resource utilization, and service quality to support data-driven decision-making.
