# Hospital Operations and Patient Analytics Dashboard using Power BI – A Case Study on Papollo Hospitals
## The project is a Power BI interactive dashboard built for Papollo Hospitals, focusing on analyzing hospital operations and patient data. The dashboard covers multiple aspects including admissions, discharges, follow-ups, billing, insurance claims, bed occupancy, diagnostics, and doctor performance.

The goal of the project is to help hospital management gain actionable insights into patient flow, financial performance, resource utilization, and service quality to support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Billing Amount** (e.g., ₹190.43M)  
- **Health Insurance Coverage %** = Insurance Amount / Billing Amount  
- **Bed Occupancy Rate** (by ward type: Private / General / ICU)  
- **Patient Volume** (total, by ward, by diagnosis)  
- **Top Diagnoses** (counts and % share)  
- **Revenue by Diagnostic Test** (CT, MRI, X-Ray, Blood Test, Ultrasound)  
- **Top Doctors by Feedback Volume** (e.g., Mark Joy – 4.83K)  
- **Admission vs Discharge Trend** (time series)  
- **Follow-up Rate** = Follow-up Patients / Admitted Patients  
- **Average Feedback Score** (if feedback rating present)

## Key Insights (summary)
- **Revenue:** Total billing is strong (e.g., ₹190.43M); diagnostics like CT, MRI, and X-Ray are high revenue contributors.  
- **Insurance:** A notable portion of billing comes from insurance — important for receivables tracking.  
- **Bed Utilization:** Usage patterns differ across Private/General/ICU; helps with capacity planning.  
- **Diagnosis Trends:** Viral infections and flu are among top diagnosis categories — suggests seasonal resource planning for labs/medicine.  
- **Doctor Performance:** Certain doctors show high feedback volume — useful for service-quality recognition and training.

## Conclusion
The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive operational view that helps Papollo Hospitals:
- Optimize bed allocation and resource planning.  
- Focus on high-margin diagnostic services.  
- Track insurance vs direct collections to manage cash flow.  
- Monitor doctor performance and patient satisfaction for service improvement.
